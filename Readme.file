 Save Webpage
This is a single-page web application that showcases a "Bundle & Save" product section, designed to match a provided Figma design. The page allows users to select from different product bundles, view pricing details, and customize their selection before adding it to a cart.

Features
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Interactive Options: Users can select one of three bundle options by clicking on the box or the radio button.

Dynamic UI: When a user selects a multi-unit bundle (e.g., "2 Unit"), the page dynamically reveals size and color selection fields.

Real-time Price Update: The total price displayed at the bottom of the page automatically updates to reflect the cost of the selected bundle.

"Most Popular" Badge: A visually distinct badge highlights the recommended bundle option.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Used for the basic structure and semantic organization of the page.

CSS3: All styling, including the responsive design and visual effects, is implemented using custom CSS, without any external frameworks.

Vanilla JavaScript: Handles all interactive elements, such as the bundle selection, showing/hiding options, and updating the total price.

This comprehensive, single-file approach fulfills all of requirements for implementation, structure, and functionality.
